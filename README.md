# ccc

Credit card case: customer segmentation, randomized card-offer experiments and drift
monitoring, tested on a seeded 60-day simulation. See `docs/design.md`.

Python 3.12, managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```
uv sync
uv run pytest -q
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
```

- `ccc.rng`: per-customer, per-stream generators derived from a stable hash of the root seed.
- `ccc.timeutil`: UTC to America/New_York dates, calendar-day windows, snapshot cutoffs.
- `ccc.sim`: seeded simulator (profiles, events, scenario overlay). Run
  `uv run python -m ccc.sim --seed 1 --days 60 --scenario scenarios/default.toml --out data/sim`.
  Tests that fit SDV are marked `slow` (`uv run pytest -m slow`).
